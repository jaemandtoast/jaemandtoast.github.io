This is JaeMin, a newbie to HTML and CSS who stumbled upon the site html5up.net as she was trying to look for templates for her first github.
A HUGE shoutout to the creator of the site for creating and providing such lovely templates. Looking through them and editing bits and pieces of the template according to my personal preference have significantly expedited my learning process of HTML5 and CSS. I hope that this website will eventually look very different from the original template as I continue to make edits in the future. This certain template that I'm using is Twenty, a minimal, multi-page responsive site template for HTML5 UP.

"As the name implies, this is my twentieth (!) design for HTML5 UP. Since the last
few have been single page affairs, I decided to go with something a bit more conventional
and threw in four extra page layouts. Beyond that, it's the usual drill: fully responsive,
built on HTML5/CSS3/skel, and CCA licensed like all my other stuff. Sass sources are
also included for those of you into that sort of thing (entirely optional)."
